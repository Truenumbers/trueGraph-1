# trueGraph
Graphs to display truenumbers primarily using d3
These graphs are all little experiments in various forms of hierarchical view, 
all using d3 and messing about with ways of representing the hierarchy in json. 
I'm thinking that I want to us a fairly flat array of objects and the d3.nest() 
functionality to choose hierarchy.  That way if we want to resort what is contained 
in what we can.
